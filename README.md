# ios-failable
Either monad to simplify data in completion blocks

Heavily influenced by [Fallible](https://gist.github.com/brentdax/f9ed95550ea0afac9505) by [brentdax](https://github.com/brentdax) and [Result](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Source/Result.swift) of [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire). Failable data is either [mappable](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper) or an NSError.
